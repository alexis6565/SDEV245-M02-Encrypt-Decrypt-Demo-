I created 2 seperate files, one that encrypts and decrypts a file using the python built in AES symmetric Fernet from 
the python cryptography library, and the other file uses an RSA asymmetric encryption in the python cryptograpy library.
Both text files contain the message "Hello World" that have been encrypted and decrypted in the VScode terminal.
